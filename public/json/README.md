If you don't want to spoil yourself to the game. Do not open any of these json files. These contain the answers to all Saltong games.

**So why are they in your public repo?**

Well... this started only as a personal project, and to keep it small I focused on working on the game itself instead of setting up a database.

Also now with this much traffic, it's more cost-efficient to save the answers as static assets than records on a database which is called thousands of times a day.

**Do you have any plans to move it somewhere we cannot see it?**

I have plans to host it in a separate CDN or just put it in a database and cough up the money, but then I need time to refactor a lot of the code and time is scarce in this household. üòÜ

**Can I help do that instead, I have lots of time.**

Sure! That's the beauty of open source. We spend hours working on something not for profit (sadt) but for the sense of achievement by doing something you thought you can't do. Yay!

And if you still want to help, we could have a chat on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/carldegs), the unannounced [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zr9u2yf2md), or through [email](mailto:carl@carldegs.com).
